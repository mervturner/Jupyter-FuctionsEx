    "## Python Exercises - Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the completion of this exercise you should understand how to:\n",
    " * Write a function\n",
    " * Write a function with a return type\n",
    " * Use the return keyword\n",
    " * Call a function and provide arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "In this exercise we will be looking at how we can write reusable blocks of code by \n",
    "declaring and calling functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn about the difference between a function that returns a value (has a \n",
    "return type), and a function that returns nothing. You will also learn about the \n",
    "distinction between parameters and arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "For the following tasks, you will be provided minimal instructions, and have to rely on \n",
    "the guidance and your own research to complete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with an existing folder called function_exercises. Your work \n",
    "should be placed inside of this folder, which uses the following structure:\n",
    "function_exercises/\n",
    "└── program.py\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a single .py file, which will contain all of your work"
