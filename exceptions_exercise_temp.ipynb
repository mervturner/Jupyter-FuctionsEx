    "### Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the completion of this exercise you should understand how to:\n",
    " * Use a try statement\n",
    " * Use an except clause\n",
    " * Use exception handling to perform validation\n",
    " * Raise an exception\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "In this exercise we will be looking at \n",
    " * how we can handle exceptions using a try statement with except clauses, \n",
    " * how this can be used for validation, and \n",
    " * how we can create and raise exceptions ourselves\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "For the following tasks, you will be provided minimal instructions, and have to rely on the guidance and your own research to complete them.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with an existing Python script called exception_exercises where you should place all of your work.\n",
